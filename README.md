# Full Stack Coding Challenge
Welcome to the IBM BR CIC Full Stack Coding Challenge.  The coding challenge is designed to enhance the skills of IBM resources seeking to build a foundation as a full stack developer.  In this coding challenge, you will implement applications using leading technology stacks to build Single Page Applications (SPA).


# Before You Get Started
1. Install [JDK 1.8](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html) or later.  &nbsp;JDK 1.8 is recommended for the challenge.
2. Install [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
3. Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
4. Preferred IDEs.  However, feel free to use the IDE of your liking.
    * Install [Spring Tool Suite (STS)](https://spring.io/tools) for Java.
    * Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
5. Create a [Docker Hub Account](https://hub.docker.com/) 
6. Create an [IBM Cloud Account](https://cloud.ibm.com) 
7. Create an [IBM GitHub Account](https://github.ibm.com/) 
8. If you are not familiar with Git commands, feel free to find an online training tutorial or enroll in the [Udemy Course - Git for Geeks](https://ibm-learning.udemy.com/course/git-for-geeks/).
9. Finally, **fork** the Git repository.
