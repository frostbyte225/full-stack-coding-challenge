# Full Stack Coding Challenge
Welcome to the IBM BR CIC Java Full Stack Coding Challenge.  The coding challenge is designed to build the skills of apprentices and entry level associates seeking a path as a Java Full Stack developer with a cloud native approach.  The challenge leverages the technologies highly in demand by our clients.  These technologies are not limited too but include Java, Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, Docker, Docker Compose, Kubernetes, Angular and React.  There are eight components (containers) that should be running simultaneously:  

- Two UIs (Angular and React) running in parallel 
- Four Spring Boot Applications
- Two Databases (SQL or NoSQL).  

The ultimate goal is the Journey to the Cloud which is accomplished by deploying the challenge on a cloud platform of the associate's choice:  AWS, Azure, IBM Cloud, Google Cloud, or Red Hat OpenShift.
